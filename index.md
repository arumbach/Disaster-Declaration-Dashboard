<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:700; margin-bottom:16px;">About Me</h2>

*Disaster and climate researcher exploring the science and policy of building safer and more resilient neighborhoods and communities.*

I am a disaster scientist, Senior Fellow and co-lead of the Climate and Communities program at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. Rumbach is a leading expert on planning and policy-making for natural hazards, disasters and climate change impacts in the United States. His areas of emphasis include affordable housing, zoning and land-use planning, federal disaster policy and community recovery after disasters.

I have published broadly on disaster and climate related topics in venues like *Natural Hazards*, *Natural Hazards Review*, *Housing Studies*, the *Journal of Urban Affairs*, and *Habitat International* and sit on the editorial boards of the *Journal of the American Planning Association* and the *Journal of Planning Literature*.

Before joining the Urban Institute in 2023, I was a tenured professor of urban planning at Texas A&M University and before that the University of Colorado Denver. I have a BA in political science from Reed College and a PhD and MRP in city and regional planning from Cornell University.
