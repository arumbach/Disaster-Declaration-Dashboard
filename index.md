<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:700; margin-bottom:16px;">About Me</h2>

I am a Senior Fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC where I co-lead the [Climate and Communities Program](https://www.urban.org/expertise/climate-change-disasters-and-community-resilience). Here on my personal website and on [my blog](https://andrewrumbach.substack.com/) I share evidence-based insights on U.S. disaster and climate change policy.

Andrew Rumbach, PhD, is a Senior Fellow and co-lead of the Climate and Communities program at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. Rumbach is a leading expert on planning and policy-making for natural hazards, disasters and climate change impacts in the United States. His areas of emphasis include affordable housing, zoning and land-use planning, federal disaster policy and community recovery after disasters.

He has published dozens of peer-reviewed studies on disaster and climate related topics in venues like Natural Hazards, Natural Hazards Review, Housing Studies, the Journal of Urban Affairs, and Habitat International and sits on the editorial boards of the Journal of the American Planning Association and the Journal of Planning Literature.

Before joining the Urban Institute in 2023, Rumbach was a tenured professor of urban planning at Texas A&M University and before that the University of Colorado Denver. He earned a BA in political science from Reed College and a PhD and MRP in city and regional planning from Cornell University.
